<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Rate my Landlord is a resource I have been wanting to build since living in my small college town. Most students come from out of college towns and do not have any insights on their potential landlords. Currently, two other applications show up when searching for them and they are not user friendly or very useful. I am building this application to showcase the skills and knowledge I have gained while working towards my Computer Science degree at Oregon State Univesity in Corvallis, Oregon. I have the most experience working on the back-end of application and am working on learning React to complete the front-end of the application. Testing is done through Postman. 

### Currently the features of this application include:

* User autorization and authentication
* RESTful API made with a non-relational database
* Search funtionality
* CRUD functionalities
* Templating using EJS

### Features I am working on implementing:
* Complete the landing page
* Add secure HTTPS
* Add a landlords rating system
* Connect Google maps API

The application is still a work on progress. If you have any suggestions feel free to contact me.
